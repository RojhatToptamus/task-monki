# Status Row Redesign

**Implementation status:** Implemented on 2026-06-20.

The implementation follows the proposal with two deliberate adjustments:

- `Workflow` is shown before `Local` and `Delivery` because workflow phase is the primary human-facing state.
- The verdict line only promotes a finding whose severity matches the current health value. Historical findings remain in the Findings panel but are not presented as the current verdict after health changes.

The task prompt panel was also made collapsible in the same UI slice. It is collapsed by default, shows the prompt line count and repository path, and keeps operational metadata visible.

**Scope:** The status section in the task detail view — currently `.status-strip` in [`TaskDetail.tsx:184-199`](../src/renderer/ui/TaskDetail.tsx#L184-L199). This is a focused spin-off of the broader [UI redesign plan](./UI_REDESIGN_PLAN.md); it covers only the 14-badge status row.

**Nature of change:** Presentation only. No change to `toneForValue` ([`StatusBadge.tsx`](../src/renderer/ui/StatusBadge.tsx)), the projection reducer ([`reducer.ts`](../src/core/projection/reducer.ts)), or the contract ([`contracts.ts`](../src/shared/contracts.ts)). Same data, better organized.

## 1. The problem

The current row renders **14 equal-weight items in one wrapping line**. Every dimension has identical size, dot treatment, and priority, so the eye has no entry point and the most important field is impossible to find at a glance.

```
● Workflow REVIEW   ● Worktree PRESENT   ● Git DIRTY   ● Tests NOT_RUN   ● GitHub READY
● Publish NOT_PUSHED   ● PR UNLINKED   ● Checks NOT_APPLICABLE   ● Reviews NOT_APPLICABLE
● Merge NOT_APPLICABLE   ● Process EXITED   ● Codex COMPLETED   ● Repository VALID   ● Health BLOCKED
```

Three distinct issues:

1. **No grouping** — unrelated dimensions sit side by side.
2. **Dead states are noise** — `NOT_APPLICABLE` / `NOT_PUSHED` / `UNLINKED` take full-size slots while carrying "nothing here yet."
3. **The verdict is buried** — `Health BLOCKED` (the reason the task is stuck) is last, same size as everything else.

---

## 2. Change 1 — Promote `Health` to a verdict line (highest priority)

`health` is **not a peer** of the other 13 fields. The reducer derives it as a roll-up across all of them ([`reducer.ts:344-411`](../src/core/projection/reducer.ts#L344-L411)): `maxHealth(...)` aggregates warnings/errors, transition-block sets `BLOCKED`, failures set `ERROR`. So `Health BLOCKED` is the single-glance summary of *why the task is where it is* — and it currently sits at position 14.

**Suggestion:** Remove `Health` from the strip and render it as one verdict chip directly under the H1, paired with the top finding message.

- Chip color from health tone: `BLOCKED`/`ERROR` → danger, `WARNING` → warning, `INFO`/healthy → success/neutral.
- The Findings panel keeps the full list; this is just the one-line verdict.
- Smallest change, biggest clarity gain.

## 3. Change 2 — Group the remaining badges

The 13 remaining fields are already three logical clusters in the contract ([`contracts.ts:230-243`](../src/shared/contracts.ts#L230-L243)). Render them as three labeled groups instead of one flat strip.

| Group | Fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Local** | Worktree, Git, Tests, Process, Codex | State on this machine / the run |
| **Remote** | GitHub, Publish, PR, Checks, Reviews, Merge | The PR delivery pipeline |
| **Workflow** | Workflow phase, Repository | Where the task sits + repo preflight |

```
LOCAL     ● Worktree PRESENT   ● Git DIRTY   ○ Tests NOT_RUN   ● Process EXITED   ● Codex COMPLETED
REMOTE    ● GitHub READY   ○ Publish NOT_PUSHED   ○ PR UNLINKED   · Checks —   · Reviews —   · Merge —
WORKFLOW  ● Phase REVIEW   ● Repository VALID
```

- Group label: muted, ~11px, left-aligned, sentence or small-caps (kept quiet — it encodes real structure, not decoration).
- Each group is its own flex-wrap row, so the layout stays responsive.

---

## 4. Change 3 — De-emphasize inactive states

Checks / Reviews / Merge read `NOT_APPLICABLE` and Publish / PR read `NOT_PUSHED` / `UNLINKED` only because no PR exists yet. They're correctly toned `neutral` already, but they still compete with live data for attention.

Pick either (or both):

- **Hollow vs. filled dot:** active states use a filled dot (`●`); neutral / `NOT_*` / `UNLINKED` values use a hollow dot (`○`) and dimmer text. Pure CSS on the existing tone class — recedes without disappearing.
- **Collapse the Remote group until a PR exists:** when `branchPublication === NOT_PUSHED` and `githubPullRequest === UNLINKED`, show a single muted line instead of six badges:
  ```
  REMOTE    GitHub READY · delivery not started
  ```
  Expand to full badges once a branch is pushed / PR is linked.

With Health promoted and inactive items recessed, the strip drops from 14 noisy items to ~6–8 meaningful ones.

## 5. Before / after

```
BEFORE (one flat row, 14 items)
● Workflow REVIEW  ● Worktree PRESENT  ● Git DIRTY  ● Tests NOT_RUN  ● GitHub READY
● Publish NOT_PUSHED  ● PR UNLINKED  ● Checks NOT_APPLICABLE  ● Reviews NOT_APPLICABLE
● Merge NOT_APPLICABLE  ● Process EXITED  ● Codex COMPLETED  ● Repository VALID  ● Health BLOCKED

AFTER

WORKFLOW  ● Phase REVIEW   ● Repository VALID
```

## 6. Implementation notes

- All changes live in [`TaskDetail.tsx`](../src/renderer/ui/TaskDetail.tsx) (the `.status-strip` JSX) plus CSS in [`styles.css`](../src/renderer/styles.css).
- `StatusBadge` stays as-is for the active badges; the hollow-dot variant is a CSS modifier driven by the existing resolved tone (`neutral`).
- The verdict chip can reuse `StatusBadge` tone logic or be a small purpose-built element — either way it reads `task.projection.health` and the first `task.projection.findings` entry.
- No new data is required: every value shown already exists on `task.projection`.

## 7. Implemented order

1. Promote `Health` to the verdict line.
2. Group into Local / Remote / Workflow rows.
3. De-emphasize inactive states (hollow dot + collapse Remote).

## 8. How to view or test

1. Open any task detail.
2. Confirm current health and its summary appear directly below the task title.
3. Confirm statuses are grouped as Workflow, Local, and Delivery.
4. On a task without a published branch or PR, confirm Delivery shows GitHub status plus `Delivery not started`.
5. Open a task with delivery activity and confirm Publish, PR, Checks, Reviews, and Merge appear.
6. Confirm the Prompt panel starts collapsed and toggles with `Show prompt` / `Hide prompt`.
7. Confirm task metadata remains visible while the prompt is collapsed.

Run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```
